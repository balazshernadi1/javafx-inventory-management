# javafx-inventory-management

A JavaFX application which connects to a database via Hibernate and mimics inventory management features.

# Introduction

WheelWorks Management is a desktop JavaFX app for bicycle retailers to manage inventory (bikes and the parts that make them), built with Hibernate and backed by Azure SQL Server. Staff can view stock, purchase/order items, create sale listings, run reports, and search inventory. Role-based access control (RBAC) keeps permissions clear across employee types.

This project was created for an Object-Oriented Software Development module to demonstrate software design, software engineering, and database modelling skills learned in class.

# Key Features

- Store and manage bikes and bike parts/accessories.
-	See the quantity of each product in stock that is stored or available for purchase.
-	Buy products to increase stock levels and sell products to decrease stock levels, while also logging each transaction.
-	Search for specific products by their name, category, or ID.
-	Generate single product reports with product details and stock level, or an all-stock report
-	Authentication and Authorisation by utilising some sort of Role-Based Access Control architecture.
-	Separation of duties by distinguishing different roles (e.g. employee and manager) and their respective permissions
-	Allow users with administrative roles to change usersâ€™ account status to either approved or disabled.

# Database

Data is stored in Azure SQL Server. The app relies on T-SQL features and is intended to run against Azure SQL.

## Modelling the database

Entities that were designed to be a part of the database.

| Entity            | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `User`            | Stores user account information, credentials, and approval status.               |
| `Role`            | Defines user roles within the system for access control (e.g., Admin, User).     |
| `User_Role`       | Links users to their assigned roles in a many-to-many relationship.              |
| `Role_Permission` | Assigns a set of permissions to each role in a many-to-many relationship.        |
| `Permission`      | Defines a specific permission by combining a resource and an operation.          |
| `Resource`        | Lists system entities that can have permissions applied to them (e.g., Product). |
| `Operation`       | Defines actions that can be performed on resources (e.g., CREATE, DELETE).       |
| `ProductCategory` | Classifies products into different categories.                                   |
| `Product`         | Acts as the central table holding core, static information for every product.    |
| `Order`           | Records user order details, linking a user to the products they purchased.       |
| `Listing`         | Represents a product available for sale, including its price and quantity.       |
| `Stock`           | Tracks the inventory levels and stock details for each product.                  |
| `Product_Image`   | Associates one or more images with a specific product.                           |
| `Image`           | Stores the file path or reference for each image.                                |

### **A notable design choice**

**Requirement:** at least two product types stored in the database with distinct attributes.

To model this in the database, I evaluated two approaches:

1. Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV)

At first, EAV seemed attractive due to its complete flexibility. However, once I started thinking on a realistic product scale, it quickly made me realise that it is problematic for scalability, query complexity, constraints, and indexing
A quick search for my idea revealed to me that this is a major anti-pattern, a company-destroying anti-pattern. Thus, I dropped this idea, *partially*.

2. Table-Per-Product

A normalised Product table with shared attributes, alongside subtype tables (Bike, Brake) for unique attributes, linked 1-to-1 to the Product table. 
This solution seemed to have the most integrity for a relational database. However, adding a new product would've required the creation of a new table with its own unique attributes. Furthermore, adding and removing attributes would've broken the simplest normalisation rules. Finally, over time, deeply nested relationships accumulate.

**The chosen approach**

I went with a hybrid option. I kept the Product table with common shared attributes, but defined an NVARCHAR column to store unique product-specific attributes in a JSON format.

The formatting :

```
{
  attribute_list [
     name
     value
     unit
     data_type
  ]
  component_list[
     product_id
     display_name
  ]
}
```

*Why does this work here?*
- The workload is read-heavy with infrequent writes (apart from initialisation), so JSON reads are acceptable as it is greatly supported in T-SQL.
- Preserves flexibility without going full EAV. 

*Why could it be an issue*
- JSON column becomes a junk drawer, and complex entities with many attributes create a large JSON.
- Complex queries utilising the contents of the JSON column may become too large and unreadable.
- Breaks relational integrity.

**A better solution for the future**

Keep the Product table for shared attributes and create appropriate subtype tables for complex entities, e.g. Brake, Motor, Gear. Define the common attributes for each entity, but leave an NVARCHAR column for truly unique attributes.
This would result in greater relational integrity and would make querying less complex.

# Software Architecture

I have chosen a layered approach, which might seem like overengineering for the size of the project, but it has taught me a lot. This allowed me to create a modular application that is extensible.

## Data Access Object (DAO) layer

The sole purpose of the DAOs is to communicate with the database using Hibernate's Session and return JPA entities.

Class diagram showcasing the DAO layer.

The core idea is to have the GenericDAO define a shared interface and an abstract implementation for common database operations. While actual DAOs (e.g. ProductDAOImpl) inherit the GenericDAO operations defined, while also implement their own specific interface.

```java
public interface UserDAO extends GenericDAO<User> {

    /** Retrieves all permissions assigned to a user through their roles */
    List<Permission> getAllUserPermissions(User user, Session session);
    
    /** Finds a user by their unique username for authentication */
    User findUserByName(String username, Session session);
    
    /** Retrieves all users with pending approval status for administrative review */
    List<User> getAllPendingUsers(Session session);
    
    /** Deactivates a user account by setting status to disabled */
    void deleteUserById(int id, Session session);
    
    /** Approves a pending user account by updating their status */
    void approveUserById(int id, Session session);
}
```

As seen on the diagram, there are only two concrete implementations, the ProductDAOImpl and UserDAOImpl. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I wasn't able to fully decouple other database-specific operations from the service layer into their own respective DAOs.
